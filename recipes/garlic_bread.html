    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>

            <li> stick salted butter, softened</li>
            
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            
            <li>tablespoons fresh chopped herbs, such as basil and/or parsley</li>
            
            <li>2 (11-oz package) refrigerated French bread loaf dough</li>
            
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C). Lightly coat an 8.5 to 9 inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>

            <li>Combine butter, garlic, and herbs in a medium bowl and stir until well blended. Unroll 1 can of bread dough onto a flat surface. Spread half of butter mixture over the dough and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese and 1 cup of mozzarella. Cut the dough into 12 squares.  Repeat with remaining dough, butter, and cheeses. 
            Stack the dough squares on top of each other and arrange them in the prepared baking dish.</li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and cooked through in the center, 40 to 50 minutes. If bread becomes too dark,  loosely cover with foil halfway through baking.</li>
            
            <li>Allow bread to cool about 5 minutes before removing the loaf to a serving tray.</li>
